### The idea

The idea behind droidDevNews is to create a place for Android Developers, where they can find interesting articles, podcasts and videos, curated by other developers.

So, basicly droidDevNews is Android developer hub with news and events 👨🏼‍💻(currently I'm working on Android version on the app, but I also plan to develop iOS version).

App is already released on Google Play - feel free to use it! 🧑🏼‍🚀
