### The idea

The idea behind droidDevNews is to create a place for Android Developers, where they can find interesting articles, podcasts and videos, curated by other developers. Updated daily, thanks to the community.

droidDevNews is Android developer app with news and events 🧑🏼‍💻 (currently I’m working on Android version on the app, but I also plan to develop iOS version).
